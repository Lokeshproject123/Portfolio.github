        MY EDUCATION HISTORY

        SCHOOL
    </font>
</h2>
<p>I completed my <mark>secondary school of education zphs  school</mark> located in my home town  reddypalli.where I studied nearly three years 
    in this school .I spent most of the time with my friends only.I <u> scored 75%</u> im my tenth grade.I mainly trust that school is the basic 
    foundation for the <s>students</s> to learn any aspect either it is studies or games.school is the <b>first pillar</b> for growth in any ones<i> life.</i>

</p>
<h2>
   <font color="yellow">
    INTERMEDIATE:-
   </font>
    
</h2>
<p>
    later on i joined in<mark> SRI SATYA SAI JUNIOR COLLEGE</mark> in anantapur .later on i realised that this <u>intermediate</u> courses are only meant for exams
    purpose not for gaining<s> knowledge.</s>here in this <b>college </b>I couldn't make any friend close to me ,because everyone is running like a machine to 
    score marks.no one konws that those marks are meant only for joining in an engineering college.moreover I spent most of my time to complete the intermediate
    course.at the end i<i> scored 75%</i>.i learned one thing from these two years is that i lost lot of precious time in my life.

        B.TECH

</h2>
<p>
    with the help of EAMCET marks I got placed in<mark> SANSKRITHI SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING COLLEGE</mark> in the stream of<u> MECHANICAL ENGINEERING</u> .here we can learn a lot not only related to subjects and also about the life.
    we have the most precious chance  to show what we are good at.we can learn more things like <s>seminars</s>and also can particate and get more<b> certificiates </b> programs 
    related to education conducted many colleges .the most painful thing is that there are many <i>sem exams</i>,internals,record ,midterms,assignments,etc,
    which makes us to feel dizzy.finally after four years the day has come ,were I scored 75%.our college provides placements which are the stepping stone
    for the prefessinal career were we won't be able to live a peaceful life and also more responsibilities will hang on us.as i say that,we need update according to the  modern technologies that are releasing 
    one by one .with that only we can keep up with the society.
